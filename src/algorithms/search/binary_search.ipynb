    "# Binary Search Algorithm in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary search** is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Binary Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "    - Start with two pointers: `low` at the beginning of the list and `high` at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the Middle**:\n",
    "    - Calculate the middle index of the current range:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compare Middle Value**:\n",
    "    - Compare the target value with the value at the middle index:\n",
    "        - If the target value is equal to the middle value, you have found the item and can return the index.\n",
    "        - If the target value is less than the middle value, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` (because the target must be in the lower half of the current range).\n",
    "        - If the target value is greater than the middle value, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` (because the target must be in the upper half of the current range).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**:\n",
    "    - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `low` is greater than `high`. If `low` exceeds `high`, the target is not in the list, and you can return a special value (like `-1`) to indicate the item was not found.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a sorted list of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 100]`, and you want to find the number `42`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial range**: `low = 0`, `high = 99`.\n",
    "2. **First iteration**:\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid = (0 + 99) // 2 = 49`.\n",
    "    - Compare `42` with `list[49]` (which is `50`).\n",
    "    - Since `42` is less than `50`, move `high` to `49 - 1 = 48`\n",
    "3. **Second iteration**:\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid = (0 + 48) // 2 = 24`.\n",
    "    - Compare `42` with `list[24]` (which is `25`).\n",
    "    - Since `42` is greater than `25`, move `low` to `24 + 1 = 25`.\n",
    "4. **Third iteration**:\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid = (25 + 48) // 2 = 36`.\n",
    "    - Compare `42` with `list[36]` (which is `37`).\n",
    "    - Since `42` is greater than `37`, move `low` to `36 + 1 = 37`.\n",
    "5. **Fourth iteration**:\n",
    "    - Calculate `mid = (37 + 48) // 2 = 42`.\n",
    "    - Compare `42` with `list[42]` (which is `42`).\n",
    "    - Target found at index `42` which in list case is equal to `list[42] == 43`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorith complexity: \n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the binary search algorithm is **O(log⁡n)**, where nn is the number of elements in the sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "• Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.\n",
    "• O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of\n",
    "items you’re searching through grows.\n",
    "• Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.\n",
    "• Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.\n",
    "• Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.\n",
