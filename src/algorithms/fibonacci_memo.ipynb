    "Without memoization, the Fibonacci function has an exponential time complexity O(2^n) because:\n",
    "- For calculating F(n), we need F(n-1) and F(n-2)\n",
    "- For F(n-1), we need F(n-2) and F(n-3)\n",
    "- For F(n-2), we need F(n-3) and F(n-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to many duplicate calculations. For example, F(n-2) is calculated both when calculating F(n) and F(n-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "With memoization:\n",
    "1. We store each calculated Fibonacci value in a dictionary\n",
    "2. Before calculating any value, we check if it's already in our dictionary\n",
    "3. This reduces the time complexity to O(n) since we calculate each Fibonacci number exactly once\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference becomes dramatic as n increases. Without memoization, calculating F(50) would take billions of operations, but with memoization, it requires just 50 unique calculations."
