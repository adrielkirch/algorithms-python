    "# Grading Round Up Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "HackerLand University has the following grading policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.\n",
    "* Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.\n",
    "* If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)\n",
    "* grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 38)\n",
    "* grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function `gradingStudents` with the following parameter(s):\n",
    "* int grades[n]: the grades before rounding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "* int[n]: the grades after rounding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.\n",
    "Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "* 1 ≤ n ≤ 60\n",
    "* 0 ≤ grades[i] ≤ 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "4\n",
    "73\n",
    "67\n",
    "38\n",
    "33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "75\n",
    "67\n",
    "40\n",
    "33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation 0\n",
    "\n",
    "* Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75. Since 75 - 73 < 3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.\n",
    "* Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70 - 67 = 3, which is not less than 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.\n",
    "* Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40 - 38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.\n",
    "* Student 4 received a grade below 38, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33."
