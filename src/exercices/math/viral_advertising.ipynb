    "# Viral Advertising Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "HackerLand Enterprise is launching a new product and they want to advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the viral advertising works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Day 1**: The company advertises to exactly 5 people\n",
    "   - On the first day, half of those 5 people (5//2 = 2) like the advertisement and share it with 3 friends each\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Day 2**: At the beginning of the second day, 5//2 * 3 = 6 people receive the advertisement\n",
    "   - Half of those 6 people (6//2 = 3) like it and share it with 3 friends each\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Day 3**: At the beginning of the third day, 6//2 * 3 = 9 people receive the advertisement\n",
    "   - And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern:\n",
    "- Each day, the number of people who receive the advertisement is calculated from the previous day\n",
    "- Half of the people who receive it (using floor division) like it\n",
    "- Each person who likes it shares it with exactly 3 friends\n",
    "- The next day, those friends receive the advertisement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "Given the number of days `n`, determine how many people liked the advertisement during the first `n` days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Day 1: 5 people receive → 2 people like it → Cumulative likes = 2\n",
    "- Day 2: 6 people receive → 3 people like it → Cumulative likes = 2 + 3 = 5\n",
    "- Day 3: 9 people receive → 4 people like it → Cumulative likes = 5 + 4 = 9\n",
    "- Day 4: 12 people receive → 6 people like it → Cumulative likes = 9 + 6 = 15\n",
    "- Day 5: 18 people receive → 9 people like it → Cumulative likes = 15 + 9 = 24\n",
    "\n",
    "So if n = 5, the function should return 24."
