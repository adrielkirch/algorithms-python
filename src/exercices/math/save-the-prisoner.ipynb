    "# Save the Prisoner\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **5** prisoners, **2** pieces of candy and distribution starts at chair **1**. The prisoners arrange themselves in seats numbered **1** to **5**. Prisoners receive candy at positions **1, 2**. The prisoner to be warned sits in chair number **2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `saveThePrisoner` function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the chair number of the prisoner to warn.\n",
    "\n",
    "`saveThePrisoner` has the following parameter(s):\n",
    "- **int n**: the number of prisoners\n",
    "- **int m**: the number of sweets\n",
    "- **int s**: the chair number to begin passing out sweets from\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- **int**: the chair number of the prisoner to warn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains an integer, **t**, the number of test cases.\n",
    "The next **t** lines each contain 3 space-separated integers:\n",
    "- **n**: the number of prisoners\n",
    "- **m**: the number of sweets\n",
    "- **s**: the chair number to start passing out treats at\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ t ≤ 100\n",
    "- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9\n",
    "- 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9\n",
    "- 1 ≤ s ≤ n\n",

    "## Explanation 0\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first query, there are **5** prisoners and **2** sweets. Distribution starts at seat number **1**. Prisoners in seats numbered **1** and **2** get sweets. Warn prisoner **2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second query, distribution starts at seat **2** so prisoners in seats **2** and **3** get sweets. Warn prisoner **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Input 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2\n",
    "7 19 2\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "6\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first test case, there are **7** prisoners, **19** sweets and they are passed out starting at chair **2**. The candies go all around twice and there are **5** more candies passed to each prisoner from seat **2** to seat **6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second test case, there are **3** prisoners, **7** candies and they are passed out starting at seat **3**. They go around twice, and there is one more to pass out to the prisoner at seat **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Circular Distribution**: Prisoners are seated in a circle, so after prisoner **n**, we go back to prisoner **1**.\n",
    "2. **Last Candy Position**: We need to find where the **m-th** candy (last candy) will be distributed.\n",
    "3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the seating is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to handle the wraparound.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of the last candy can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "```\n",
    "position = (s + m - 1) % n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to handle the case where the result is 0 (which should map to chair n).\n",

    "## 🚀 Optimized O(1) Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we don't need to simulate the entire distribution process. We can calculate the final position directly using **modular arithmetic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Mathematical Derivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Understanding the Pattern**\n",
    "- We start at position `s`\n",
    "- We distribute `m` candies sequentially\n",
    "- The table is circular with `n` positions (1 to n)\n",
    "- We need the position of the **last** (m-th) candy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Zero-Based Indexing Approach**\n",
    "Let's convert to 0-based indexing to make modular arithmetic cleaner:\n",
    "- Positions become: 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\n",
    "- Starting position: `s-1` (0-based)\n",
    "- After distributing m candies, we've moved `m-1` steps from the start\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **The Core Formula**\n",
    "In 0-based indexing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "final_position_0_based = (starting_position_0_based + steps) % n\n",
    "final_position_0_based = (s - 1 + m - 1) % n\n",
    "final_position_0_based = (s + m - 2) % n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Converting Back to 1-Based Indexing**\n",
    "```\n",
    "final_position = final_position_0_based + 1\n",
    "final_position = ((s + m - 2) % n) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Handling the Edge Case**\n",
    "When `(s + m - 2) % n == 0`, the result is position 0 in 0-based indexing, which corresponds to position `n` in 1-based indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Optimized Formula:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (s + m - 2) % n + 1\n",
    "if result == 0:  # This happens when (s + m - 2) % n == n-1 + 1 == n == 0 (mod n)\n",
    "    result = n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more elegantly:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (s + m - 2) % n + 1\n",
    "return result if result != 0 else n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "1. **No Simulation Needed**: We calculate the exact position mathematically\n",
    "2. **Handles Large Numbers**: Works efficiently even with n, m up to 10^9\n",
    "3. **Constant Time**: O(1) complexity regardless of input size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification with Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:** n=5, m=2, s=1\n",
    "- `(1 + 2 - 2) % 5 + 1 = 1 % 5 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:** n=5, m=2, s=2  \n",
    "- `(2 + 2 - 2) % 5 + 1 = 2 % 5 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3` ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:** n=7, m=19, s=2\n",
