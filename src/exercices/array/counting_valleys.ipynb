    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly `steps` steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill `U`, or a downhill `D` step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A mountain** is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.\n",
    "- **A valley** is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "steps = 8\n",
    "path = \"UDDDUDUU\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The hiker first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain 1 unit high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `1` (one valley was traversed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `countingValleys` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `int steps`: the number of steps on the hike\n",
    "- `string path`: a string describing the path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- `int`: the number of valleys traversed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first line contains an integer `steps`, the number of steps in the hike.\n",
    "- The second line contains a single string `path`, of `steps` characters that describe the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2 ≤ steps ≤ 10^6`\n",
    "- `path[i] ∈ {U, D}`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "8\n",
    "UDDDUDUU\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Output\n",

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Track the current altitude (starting at sea level = 0)\n",
    "2. Count valleys (sequences below sea level)\n",
    "3. A valley starts when we go from sea level (0) to below sea level (-1)\n",
    "4. A valley ends when we return from below sea level back to sea level (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** We only increment the valley counter when we step **into** a valley (i.e., when altitude becomes -1 for the first time in a sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Initialize altitude = 0 and valleys = 0\n",
    "2. For each step in the path:\n",
    "   - If step is 'U': increment altitude\n",
    "   - If step is 'D': decrement altitude\n",
    "   - If altitude becomes -1 (entering a valley): increment valley counter\n",
    "3. Return the valley count"
