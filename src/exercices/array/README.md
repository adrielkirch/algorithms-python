# Array Exercises - Organized by Algorithmic Techniques

This directory contains array-based programming exercises organized by the primary algorithmic technique used to solve them.

## Folder Structure

### 📊 **hashmap/** - Hash Table/HashMap Techniques
Problems that use hash tables, sets, or dictionaries for efficient lookups, frequency counting, or duplicate detection.

### 🎯 **two_pointers/** - Two Pointers Technique  
Problems that use two pointers moving through an array, often from opposite ends or at different speeds.

### 🚀 **greedy/** - Greedy Algorithms
Problems that can be solved by making locally optimal choices at each step.

### 🪟 **slide_windown/** - Sliding Window Technique
Problems that involve maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding it across the array.

### 🔍 **binary_search/** - Binary Search
Problems that use binary search concepts for efficient searching in sorted or partially sorted data.

### 🎮 **simulation/** - Simulation Problems
Problems that require step-by-step simulation of a process or game rules.

## How to Choose the Right Technique

- **Use HashMaps** when you need fast lookups, counting frequencies, or detecting duplicates
- **Use Two Pointers** when working with sorted arrays or need to find pairs/triplets
- **Use Greedy** when local optimal choices lead to global optimum
- **Use Sliding Window** when dealing with subarrays or substrings of fixed/variable size
- **Use Binary Search** when data is sorted or you can define a search condition
- **Use Simulation** when you need to model real-world processes step by step
