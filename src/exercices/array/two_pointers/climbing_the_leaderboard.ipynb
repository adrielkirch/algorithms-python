    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses **Dense Ranking**, so its leaderboard works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard\n",
    "- Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "If leaderboard scores are `[100, 100, 50, 40, 40, 20, 10]`, the ranked players will have ranks `1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Description\n",
    "Complete the `climbingLeaderboard` function:\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `int ranked[n]`: the leaderboard scores in descending order\n",
    "  - `int player[m]`: the player's scores in ascending order\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",
    "  - `int[m]`: the player's rank after each new score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The existing leaderboard is in descending order\n",
    "- The player's scores are in ascending order"

    "- **Unique scores:** `[100, 50, 40, 20, 10]` → **Ranks:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "- **Player scores:** `[5, 25, 50, 120]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "- Score 5: Lower than all leaderboard scores → Rank 6\n",
    "- Score 25: Between 20 and 40 → Rank 4  \n",
    "- Score 50: Equal to 50 on leaderboard → Rank 2\n",
    "- Score 120: Higher than all leaderboard scores → Rank 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample 2:\n",
    "- **Leaderboard:** `[100, 90, 90, 80, 75, 60]`\n",
    "- **Unique scores:** `[100, 90, 80, 75, 60]` → **Ranks:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
