    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a given budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "keyboards = [3, 1]\n",
    "drives = [5, 2, 8]\n",
    "budget = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The person can buy a `3 + 2 = 5` or a `1 + 8 = 9`. Choose the latter as the more expensive option and return `9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `getMoneySpent` function in the editor below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**getMoneySpent has the following parameter(s):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int keyboards[n]`: the keyboard prices\n",
    "- `int drives[m]`: the drive prices  \n",
    "- `int b`: the budget\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`: the maximum that can be spent, or `-1` if it is not possible to buy both items\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first line contains three space-separated integers `b`, `n`, and `m`, the budget, the number of keyboard models and the number of USB drive models.\n",
    "- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `keyboards[i]`, the prices of each keyboard model.\n",
    "- The third line contains `m` space-separated integers `drives[i]`, the prices of the USB drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000`\n",
    "- `1 ≤ b ≤ 10^6`\n",
    "- The price of each item is in the inclusive range `[1, 10^6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Input 0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "10 2 3\n",
    "3 1\n",
    "5 2 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Output 0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The person buys a keyboard for `1` and a USB drive for `8`, spending a total of `9`. This is the maximum amount that can be spent within the budget.\n",

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find all possible combinations of one keyboard and one USB drive\n",
    "2. Check which combinations are within the budget\n",
    "3. Return the maximum total cost among valid combinations\n",
    "4. If no valid combinations exist, return -1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Initialize `max_spent = -1` (default return value if no valid combination)\n",
    "2. For each keyboard price:\n",
    "   - For each USB drive price:\n",
    "     - Calculate total cost = keyboard_price + drive_price\n",
    "     - If total cost ≤ budget and total cost > max_spent:\n",
    "       - Update max_spent = total cost\n",
    "3. Return max_spent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: O(n × m) where n = number of keyboards, m = number of USB drives\n",
    "### Space Complexity: O(1)"
