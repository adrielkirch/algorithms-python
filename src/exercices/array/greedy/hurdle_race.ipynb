    "# The Hurdle Race\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Source:** [HackerRank - The Hurdle Race](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-hurdle-race/problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "A video player plays a game in which the character competes in a hurdle race. Hurdles are of varying heights, and the character has a maximum height they can jump. There is a magic potion they can take that will increase their maximum jump height by 1 unit for each dose. How many doses of the potion must the character take to be able to jump all of the hurdles?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the character can already clear all of the hurdles, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Description\n",
    "Complete the hurdleRace function:\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `k`: the height the character can jump naturally\n",
    "  - `height[n]`: the heights of each hurdle\n",
    "- **Returns:** the minimum number of doses required, always 0 or more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "- k = 4, height = [1, 6, 3, 5, 2]\n",
    "- The character can jump 4 units high initially\n",
    "- The tallest hurdle is 6 units high\n",
    "- Must take 2 doses to jump 6 units high\n",
    "- Return 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100\n",
    "- 1 ≤ k ≤ 200\n",
    "- 1 ≤ height[i] ≤ 200"

    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "This is a greedy algorithm problem. The key insight is that we only need to consider the tallest hurdle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the maximum height among all hurdles\n",
    "2. If the character can already jump higher than or equal to the max hurdle, return 0\n",
    "3. Otherwise, return the difference between the max hurdle height and the character's natural jump height\n",

    "**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of hurdles\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(1)"
