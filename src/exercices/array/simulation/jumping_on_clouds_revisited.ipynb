    "# Jumping on the Clouds: Revisited\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A child is playing a cloud hopping game. In this game, there are sequentially numbered clouds that can be **thunderheads** or **cumulus clouds**. The character must jump from cloud to cloud until it reaches the start again.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an array of clouds `c` and an energy level `e = 100`. The character starts from `c[0]` and uses `1` unit of energy to make a jump of size `k` to cloud `c[(i+k) % n]`. If it lands on a thundercloud (`c[i] = 1`), its energy (`e`) decreases by `2` additional units. The game ends when the character lands back on cloud `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the values of `n`, `k`, and the configuration of the clouds as an array `c`, determine the final value of `e` after the game ends.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Circular Jump Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does `c[(i+k) % n]` mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%` (modulo) operation makes the array **circular** - when you reach the end, you wrap around to the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have 8 clouds (n=8) and you jump 2 clouds at a time (k=2):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Index:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    (then wraps back to 0)\n",
    "Cloud: [0,   0,   1,   0,   0,   1,   1,   0]\n",
    "        ↑                                        Start here (i=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Jumping Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jump 1:** Start at index `i = 0`, jump `k = 2` positions\n",
    "- New position: `(0 + 2) % 8 = 2`\n",
    "- You land at index 2\n",
    "\n",

    "**Jump 2:** Now at index `i = 2`, jump `k = 2` positions again\n",
    "- New position: `(2 + 2) % 8 = 4`\n",
    "- You land at index 4\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Index:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7\n",

    "- You land at index 6\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Without modulo, when at index 6 and jumping 2, you'd try to go to index 8, which doesn't exist!\n",
