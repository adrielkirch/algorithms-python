    "# Solution Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "We've implemented three different approaches to solve the tallest candles problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traditional Approach**: Uses a simple loop and conditional logic to find the tallest candle and count occurrences.\n",
    "   - Easy to understand and implement\n",
    "   - Works in all Python versions\n",
    "   - Explicitly shows the logic step by step\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List Comprehension Approach**: Uses Python's walrus operator (`:=`) for inline assignments in a list comprehension.\n",
    "   - More concise code but harder to read\n",
    "   - Requires Python 3.8+\n",
    "   - Shows advanced Python features\n",
    "   - May be less intuitive for beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pythonic Approach**: Leverages built-in functions `max()` and `count()` to solve the problem.\n",
    "   - Most concise solution\n",
    "   - Very readable once you understand built-in functions\n",
    "   - Likely the most efficient as built-in functions are optimized\n",
    "   - Best approach for real-world Python applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice\n",
    "For this specific problem, the third approach (Pythonic solution) is generally preferred because:\n",
    "- It's the most readable and maintainable\n",
    "- It has the least code to write and debug\n",
    "- It leverages Python's built-in optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "However, understanding all three approaches helps develop a comprehensive understanding of Python programming concepts and styles."
