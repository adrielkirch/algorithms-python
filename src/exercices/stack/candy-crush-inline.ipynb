    "## Explanation of the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Candy Crush problem demonstrates the use of stacks to handle sequences that need to be processed in a specific order. There are two key insights to solving this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to keep track of consecutive identical candies and their counts\n",
    "2. After crushing a group, new crushable groups may form, so we need to repeatedly process the string\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Solution**:\n",
    "   - Processes the entire string, counting consecutive identical candies\n",
    "   - Removes groups of size k or larger\n",
    "   - Recursively processes the resulting string until no changes are made\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Solution**:\n",
    "   - Uses a while loop to repeatedly process the string\n",
    "   - Continues until no more changes can be made\n",
    "   - Uses a stack to track character counts during each pass\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Multiple Crushes**: When a group is crushed, adjacent characters may now form new crushable groups. This is why we need to repeatedly process the string.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Empty strings, single characters, and exact matches of size k need special handling.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: For very long strings, we need to be careful about repeated string concatenation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n¬≤) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string\n",
    "  - Each pass through the string is O(n), and we may need up to O(n) passes\n",
    "  - In practice, the number of passes is usually much smaller than n\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n) for the stack that stores characters and their counts\n",
    "  - The recursive solution also uses O(n) space on the call stack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a simplified version of pattern matching and sequence elimination problems found in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Game mechanics (like the actual Candy Crush game)\n",
    "- Text processing (removing repeated patterns)\n",
    "- DNA sequence analysis (identifying repeating segments)\n",
    "- Compression algorithms (run-length encoding variants)\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack-based approach is particularly useful when dealing with problems that involve matching, pairing, or counting consecutive elements in a sequence."

    "# Candy Crush 1D: A Stack-Based Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we're implementing a one-dimensional version of the popular game \"Candy Crush\". Here's what we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of elements and an integer `k`, remove groups of `k` or more consecutive identical elements. After removing a group, the remaining elements collapse together. This process continues until no more groups of `k` or more identical consecutive elements exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n",
    "k = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. We start with `[1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3]`\n",
    "2. We find a group of three 3's ‚Üí remove them\n",
    "3. Array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`\n",
    "4. Now we find a group of three 2's ‚Üí remove them\n",
    "5. Array becomes `[1, 3]`\n",
    "6. No more groups of three consecutive identical elements\n",
    "7. Final result: `[1, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use a Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is the perfect data structure for this problem because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: It allows us to process the array in a single pass rather than repeatedly scanning it.\n",
    "2. **Tracking**: We can easily keep track of consecutive identical elements and their counts.\n",
    "3. **Clean Implementation**: The stack naturally handles the \"collapsing\" behavior when elements are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack to store pairs of `[value, count]`\n",
    "2. Process each element in the array:\n",
    "   - If the stack is empty or the current element differs from the top element on the stack, push `[element, 1]` onto the stack\n",
    "   - If the current element matches the top element, increment its count\n",
    "   - If the count reaches exactly `k`, pop the element from the stack (this removes the group)\n",
    "3. After processing all elements, reconstruct the final array from the remaining elements in the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the stack and result array\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this solution is its simplicity and efficiency - we can solve the problem with just a single pass through the array!"
